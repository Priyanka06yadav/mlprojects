## Project 1: Black Friday Dataset analysis
1. Built a Machine learning model to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories of a retail company.
2. Performed data cleaning.
3. Used exploratory data analysis and feature engineering techniques.
4. Dataset taken from Kaggle [Blackfriday train.csv](https://github.com/Priyanka06yadav/mlprojects/files/13060901/Blackfriday.train.csv)   [Black Friday test.csv](https://github.com/Priyanka06yadav/mlprojects/files/13060910/Black.Friday.test.csv)

## Project 2: Diabetes Prediction
1. Built a classification based machine learning model to predict if a person is diabetic or not by considering different factors such age, Blood pressure level and so on.
2. Used linear SVM supervised learning for model training.

## Project 3: House price Prediction
1. Aimed to predict sale price of houses using supervised learning
2. Used mean and mode imputation to handle missing data and performed OneHotEncoding to deal with categorical features.
3. Trained model using random forest regression algorithm.

## Project 4: Coffee Chain Dashboard
1. Created dashboard in Ms Excel to know profit distribution of different types of beverages in different part of world.
2. Used Pivot table, Slicer, Timeline, mathematical functions to analyse.
3. Dataset used -[Dataset_Coffee Chain.xlsx](https://github.com/Priyanka06yadav/mlprojects/files/13061022/Dataset_Coffee.Chain.xlsx)
